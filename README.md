# Simpl

Not a unique name I know.

> - This is an experiment creating a Hugo theme.
> - This is my first time creating a theme.
> - This is my first time navigating Hugo modules.

## Features

- Work in progress.
- It's pretty barebones.
- TailwindCSS v4.
- Has Dark and Light Mode based on system settings.
- Mobile'ish.
- There has been some attention paid to a11y, but it may still fall short while I work through things.
- Early attempts at i18n.

## Installation

I _think_ this will add or update a module:

```bash
hugo mod get -u  github.com/esacteksab/simpl
```

Then import the theme in your Hugo config:

```toml
[[module.imports]]
path = "github.com/esacteksab/simpl"
```

But that's why this exists, because I've never done this before.


**Editor's note:** _It doesn't work_. NFC why.

## Configuration

I'm not sure. Still learning.
